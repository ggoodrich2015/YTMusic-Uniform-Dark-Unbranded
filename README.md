Hi, I just wanted to share this custom CSS file I made (with the help of AI if that matters to you). I love the look of it compared to the default app. This is made for use in pear-desktop.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97d33eb2-ec1d-4d8b-8d10-718490b03345" />
