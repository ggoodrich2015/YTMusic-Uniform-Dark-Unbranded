Hi, I just wanted to share this custom CSS file I made (with the help of AI if that matters to you). I love the look of it compared to the default app. This is made for use in pear-desktop.

PLEASE NOTE: The ambient background behind the album cover is a seperate feature of pear-desktop and is not part of the theme.
